## Learning Objectives

After completing this tutorial series, you will be able to:

1. Build a time-stepped simulation model for a decision problem under deep uncertainty
2. Use **exploratory modeling** to understand how a policy performs across many plausible futures
3. Use **multi-objective optimization** to find Pareto-optimal trade-offs
4. Interpret scenario maps and Pareto fronts to support real-world decision-making

## Why This Tutorial?

Many real-world decisions---infrastructure investments, climate adaptation strategies, resource management policies---must be made *before* key uncertainties are resolved.
Standard cost-benefit analysis assumes we know (or can estimate) the probability distribution of future outcomes.
But for many problems in climate risk, water management, and infrastructure planning, we face **deep uncertainty**: we cannot confidently assign probabilities to future states of the world.

Decision Making under Deep Uncertainty (DMDU) is a family of approaches that takes this challenge seriously.
Rather than optimizing for a single "expected" future, DMDU methods stress-test candidate decisions across a wide range of plausible futures to identify strategies that perform well across many of them.

This tutorial teaches SimOptDecisions.jl through a realistic DMDU workflow, using the example of **deciding how high to elevate a house in a flood-prone area** [inspired by @zarekarizi_suboptimal:2020; see also @doss-gollin_subjective:2023].

## The Decision Problem

You own a house in a flood-prone coastal area.
Each year, storm surges threaten your property.
You must decide: **how high should you elevate your house?**

Elevating higher costs more upfront, but reduces future flood damages.
The challenge is that you face deep uncertainty about:

- **Future storm surge intensity** — The frequency and severity of future floods depends on climate variability and change, which we cannot precisely predict
- **The depth-damage relationship** — How much damage a given flood depth causes depends on building characteristics and contents, which are uncertain
- **Future economic conditions** — The discount rate used to compare present costs against future damages reflects contested value judgments

These aren't just "noise" around a known distribution.
Reasonable experts disagree about the *form* of the distribution, not just its parameters.
This is what makes the problem one of deep uncertainty rather than well-characterized risk.

## The Trade-off

- **Low elevation**: Cheap upfront, but expensive flood damages over time
- **High elevation**: Expensive construction, but minimal future damages
- **"Optimal" elevation**: Depends on your assumptions about the uncertain future

Different assumptions about storm intensity, damage functions, and discount rates lead to different "optimal" recommendations.
There is no single right answer---only trade-offs to understand.

## The DMDU Workflow

This tutorial walks through a complete DMDU analysis:

| Step | Tutorial Section | What You'll Do |
|------|-----------------|----------------|
| **Build the model** | [2. Running a Time Step](02-system-model.qmd) | Define the physics: depth-damage, construction costs |
| **Add time** | [3. Types and simulate()](03-adding-time.qmd) | Structure the model with types and run multi-year simulations |
| **Aggregate results** | [4. Outcomes and Metrics](04-outcomes-metrics.qmd) | Summarize outcomes across scenarios; choose metrics |
| **Explore** | [5. Exploratory Modeling](05-exploratory-modeling.qmd) | Map out where policies succeed and fail across the scenario space |
| **Optimize** | [6. Policy Search](06-policy-search.qmd) | Find Pareto-optimal trade-offs with multi-objective optimization |

Each section builds on the previous, using the same house elevation context throughout.

## Next Steps

In the [next section](02-system-model.qmd), we'll start building the model from the inside: what happens in a single year when a storm hits?
