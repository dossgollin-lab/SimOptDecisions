## Overview

This tutorial teaches SimOptDecisions.jl through a realistic example: **deciding how high to elevate a house in a flood-prone area**.

You'll learn:

1. **Defining your model** - Types for config, uncertainty, state, actions, and policies
2. **Running simulations** - The five-callback pattern for time-stepped models
3. **Evaluating policies** - Testing a single policy across many uncertain futures
4. **Exploratory modeling** - Systematically comparing policies across scenarios
5. **Policy search** - Multi-objective optimization to find Pareto-optimal solutions

Each section builds on the previous, using the same house elevation context throughout.

## The Decision Problem

You own a house in a flood-prone coastal area.
Each year, storm surges threaten your property.
You must decide: **how high should you elevate your house?**

Elevating higher costs more upfront, but reduces future flood damages.
The challenge is that you face deep uncertainty about:

- **Future storm surge intensity** (climate variability)
- **The relationship between flood depth and damage** (depth-damage curves)
- **Future economic conditions** (discount rates)

## The Trade-off

This is a classic decision under uncertainty:

- **Low elevation**: Cheap upfront, but expensive flood damages over time
- **High elevation**: Expensive construction, but minimal future damages
- **Optimal elevation**: Balances upfront costs against expected long-term damages

But what's "optimal" depends on assumptions about the uncertain future. Different assumptions lead to different recommendations.

## What Makes This Interesting

This problem has features common to many real-world decisions:

1. **Multi-dimensional uncertainty**: Storm intensity, damage relationships, and discount rates are all uncertain
2. **Irreversible decisions**: Once you elevate, you can't easily undo it
3. **Long time horizons**: Benefits accrue over decades
4. **Competing objectives**: Minimize upfront cost vs. minimize expected damages

SimOptDecisions.jl helps you:

- **Structure** the problem clearly (types for each concept)
- **Simulate** outcomes under different scenarios
- **Explore** how results vary across uncertainties
- **Optimize** to find the best trade-offs

## Next Steps

In the [next section](02-defining-your-model.qmd), we'll define the Julia types that represent this problem: configuration, uncertainty, state, actions, and policies.
