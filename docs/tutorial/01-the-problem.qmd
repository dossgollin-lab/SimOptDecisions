## Overview

This tutorial teaches SimOptDecisions.jl through a realistic example: **deciding how high to elevate a house in a flood-prone area**.

You'll learn by building from the inside out:

1. **The System Model** — What happens in a single year? (depth-damage, construction costs)
2. **Adding Time** — Extending to multi-year simulations with types and callbacks
3. **Outcomes and Metrics** — Aggregating results and comparing across uncertain futures
4. **Exploratory Modeling** — Systematically comparing policies across scenarios
5. **Policy Search** — Multi-objective optimization to find Pareto-optimal solutions

Each section builds on the previous, using the same house elevation context throughout.

## The Decision Problem

You own a house in a flood-prone coastal area.
Each year, storm surges threaten your property.
You must decide: **how high should you elevate your house?**

Elevating higher costs more upfront, but reduces future flood damages.
The challenge is that you face deep uncertainty about:

- **Future storm surge intensity** (climate variability)
- **The relationship between flood depth and damage** (depth-damage curves)
- **Future economic conditions** (discount rates)

## The Trade-off

This is a classic decision under uncertainty:

- **Low elevation**: Cheap upfront, but expensive flood damages over time
- **High elevation**: Expensive construction, but minimal future damages
- **Optimal elevation**: Balances upfront costs against expected long-term damages

But what's "optimal" depends on assumptions about the uncertain future. Different assumptions lead to different recommendations.

## Next Steps

In the [next section](02-system-model.qmd), we'll start building the model from the inside: what happens in a single year when a storm hits?
