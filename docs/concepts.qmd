## The Problem Setting

SimOptDecisions targets a class of decision problems with three characteristics:

1. **Sequential dynamics**: The system evolves over time through discrete steps (years, months, decision epochs). Actions taken now affect future states.
2. **Nonlinearity**: Outcomes are nonlinear functions of inputs---threshold effects, saturation, path dependence---so closed-form solutions are unavailable. Monte Carlo simulation is the natural evaluation tool.
3. **Uncertainty**: Key inputs (future climate, economic conditions, system parameters) are uncertain. Rather than optimizing for a single expected future, we evaluate decisions across an ensemble of plausible scenarios.

This setting is common in infrastructure design, climate adaptation, water resources planning, and natural hazard management.
It draws on ideas from several traditions: stochastic optimization, optimal control, reinforcement learning, engineering design, and decision making under deep uncertainty (DMDU).

## Key Vocabulary

**Scenario**
: A plausible future state of the world.
Not a prediction---a scenario represents one internally consistent set of assumptions about uncertain quantities.
In SimOptDecisions, scenarios are concrete data objects containing pre-generated inputs.

**Policy**
: A decision rule mapping system state to actions.
Specifically, we use *parametric* policy rules, meaning policy rules that have parameters we can update, improve, or optimize.

**Exploratory modeling**
: Running a model across many scenarios to understand system behavior, rather than to predict a single outcome [@bankes_exploratory:1993].
The goal is to discover *where* a policy is vulnerable.

**Pareto front**
: The set of solutions where no objective can be improved without worsening another.
In multi-objective optimization, the Pareto front characterizes the fundamental trade-offs in the problem.

## How SimOptDecisions Fits

| Workflow Step | SimOptDecisions Feature |
|---------------|------------------------|
| Define uncertain futures | `Scenario` type with parameter wrappers |
| Define candidate decisions | `Policy` type with tunable parameters |
| Simulate system response | `simulate()` with user-defined callbacks |
| Explore across futures | `explore()` → YAXArray result matrix |
| Search for optimal trade-offs | `optimize()` → Pareto front |
