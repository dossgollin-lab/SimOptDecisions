## The Problem Setting

SimOptDecisions targets a class of decision problems with three characteristics:

1. **Sequential dynamics**: The system evolves over time through discrete steps (years, months, decision epochs). Actions taken now affect future states.
2. **Nonlinearity**: Outcomes are nonlinear functions of inputs---threshold effects, saturation, path dependence---so closed-form solutions are unavailable. Monte Carlo simulation is the natural evaluation tool.
3. **Uncertainty**: Key inputs (future climate, economic conditions, system parameters) are uncertain. Rather than optimizing for a single expected future, we evaluate decisions across an ensemble of plausible scenarios.

This setting is common in infrastructure design, climate adaptation, water resources planning, and natural hazard management.
It draws on ideas from several traditions: stochastic optimization, optimal control, reinforcement learning, engineering design, and decision making under deep uncertainty (DMDU).

## Deep Uncertainty

In some problems, the probability distributions governing uncertain inputs are themselves unknown or contested.
For example, experts may disagree about the form of future storm surge distributions, not just the parameter values.
This is sometimes called **deep uncertainty** [@doss-gollin_subjective:2023].

SimOptDecisions does not require well-characterized probability distributions.
The scenario ensemble can represent any set of plausible futures---sampled from priors, drawn from expert elicitation, or constructed to stress-test specific assumptions.

## DMDU Frameworks

Decision Making under Deep Uncertainty (DMDU) is a family of approaches that share a common structure:

1. **Generate** candidate decisions (policies)
2. **Stress-test** them across many plausible futures (scenarios)
3. **Analyze** where each candidate succeeds or fails
4. **Iterate** based on what you learn

Several specific frameworks fit this pattern:

- **Robust Decision Making (RDM)** evaluates candidates across an ensemble and uses scenario discovery to identify vulnerabilities [@lempert_robust:2000]
- **Many-Objective Robust Decision Making (MORDM)** adds multi-objective optimization to search the policy space for Pareto-optimal trade-offs [@kasprzyk_mordm:2013]
- **Climate adaptation as a control problem** frames sequential investment decisions as optimal control under uncertainty [@herman_control:2020]

SimOptDecisions supports RDM and MORDM workflows natively through `explore()` and `optimize()`.

## Key Vocabulary

**Scenario**
: A plausible future state of the world.
Not a prediction---a scenario represents one internally consistent set of assumptions about uncertain quantities.
In SimOptDecisions, scenarios are concrete data objects containing pre-generated inputs.

**Policy**
: A decision rule mapping system state to actions.
A policy can be as simple as a fixed parameter (elevate 4 feet) or as complex as an adaptive rule (elevate further if cumulative damages exceed a threshold).

**Exploratory modeling**
: Running a model across many scenarios to understand system behavior, rather than to predict a single outcome [@bankes_exploratory:1993].
The goal is to discover *where* a policy is vulnerable.

**Scenario discovery**
: Identifying the conditions (regions of the scenario space) under which a policy fails to meet performance thresholds.

**Robustness**
: A property of a policy that performs acceptably well across a wide range of plausible futures, even if it is not optimal in any single one [@herman_robustness:2015].

**Pareto front**
: The set of solutions where no objective can be improved without worsening another.
In multi-objective optimization, the Pareto front characterizes the fundamental trade-offs in the problem.

## How SimOptDecisions Fits

| Workflow Step | SimOptDecisions Feature |
|---------------|------------------------|
| Define uncertain futures | `Scenario` type with parameter wrappers |
| Define candidate decisions | `Policy` type with tunable parameters |
| Simulate system response | `simulate()` with user-defined callbacks |
| Explore across futures | `explore()` → YAXArray result matrix |
| Search for optimal trade-offs | `optimize()` → Pareto front |
