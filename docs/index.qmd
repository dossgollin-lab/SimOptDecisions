## What is SimOptDecisions?

SimOptDecisions is a Julia framework for conducting exploratory modeling and simulation-optimization under uncertainty.

You provide a simulation model and a parameterized policy. The framework runs your model, aggregates the results, and facilitates visualization and policy search.

Designed to be flexible but imposes just enough structure to enable type stability, fast execution, and ergonomic APIs.

## Key Vocabulary

| Term | What it means |
|------|---------------|
| **Config** | Fixed parameters that don't change across scenarios |
| **Scenario** | One possible future (your uncertain parameters)^[Also called "State of the World" (SOW) in some decision analysis literature] |
| **Policy** | A decision rule with tunable parameters |
| **Action** | What the policy decides at each timestep |
| **State** | Your model's internal state that evolves over time |
| **Outcome** | Result of one simulation |
| **Metric** | Summary statistic across many simulations |

## How It Works

When you call `simulate(config, scenario, policy)`, the framework orchestrates your callbacks:

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
    A[simulate] --> B[time_axis]
    B --> C[initialize]
    C --> D{for t in times}
    D --> E[get_action]
    E --> F[run_timestep]
    F --> D
    D --> G[compute_outcome]
    G --> H[outcome]
```

The framework then provides higher-level functions:

- `simulate(config, scenario, policy)` — run one scenario
- `explore(config, scenarios, policies)` — systematically evaluate all combinations
- `optimize(problem, backend)` — search for Pareto-optimal policies

## Installation

Requires Julia 1.10 or later.

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add(url="https://github.com/dossgollin-lab/SimOptDecisions.jl")
```
